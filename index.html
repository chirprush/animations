            <p>Hello! My name is Rushil, and I'm really passionate about math and computer science. One of the little niches that I think really best combines these two subjects is making appealing-looking, clean animations of mathematical topics. As such, here is my current collection of math animations. I hope to make a lot more in the future!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="animations/bezier-curve/index.html"><b>Bezier Curves</b></a>: A fun little animation showing off Bezier curves running through random points.</li>
                <li><a href="animations/unit-circle-waves/index.html"><b>Unit Circle Waves</b></a>: A classic animation showing off the two waves of the unit circle.</li>
                <li><a href="animations/simplices/index.html"><b>Simplices</b></a>: With my journey into topic of simplices, I thought I would take the opportunity to make an animation projecting 4d simplices and looking at their rotations.</li>
                <li><a href="animations/graph-iterations/index.html"><b>Graph Iterations</b></a>: A cool looking (in my opinion at least) visualization of a cute little bijection between the natural numbers and graphs from graph theory.</li>
            </ul>
